# habit_tracker
## about
This is a habit tracker created using kivy by the Data Analytics & Automation Team @ ATCO during the summer 2025

## Strategy
We used SQLite to hold our data. Changes to the data are triggered by user input and are immediately committed to the database.   
We used a state variable on our app object so we can access the state using the child functions easily.
We initialize a database if there is no existing database.

## Possible Future Features
- Add interface to add habits to the habit list
- Add scroll bar to main interface and habit modification interface
- Decide on gamified elements
- Properly close the database on termination
- Data visualizations (trends)
- Streaks
- Achievment System/Badges
- Notifications
- Change order of Habits
- Habit Grouping
